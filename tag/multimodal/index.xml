      <description>&lt;p&gt;We present MILS: Multimodal Iterative LLM Solver, a surprisingly simple, training-free approach, to imbue multimodal capabilities into your favorite LLM. Leveraging their innate ability to perform multi-step reasoning, MILS prompts the LLM to generate candidate outputs, each of which are scored and fed back iteratively, eventually generating a solution to the task. This enables various applications that typically require training specialized models on task-specific data. In particular, we establish a new state-of-the-art on emergent zero-shot image, video and audio captioning. MILS seamlessly applies to media generation as well, discovering prompt rewrites to improve text-to-image generation, and even edit prompts for style transfer! Finally, being a gradient-free optimization approach, MILS can invert multimodal embeddings into text, enabling applications like cross-modal arithmetic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Movie Gen: A Cast of Media Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://rohitgirdhar.github.io/publication/2024_moviegen/</link>

      <guid>https://rohitgirdhar.github.io/publication/2024_moviegen/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We present Movie Gen, a cast of foundation models that generates high-quality, 1080p HD videos with different aspect ratios and synchronized audio. We also show additional capabilities such as precise instruction-based video editing and generation of personalized videos based on a user&amp;rsquo;s image. Our models set a new state-of-the-art on multiple tasks: text-to-video synthesis, video personalization, video editing, video-to-audio generation, and text-to-audio generation. Our largest video generation model is a 30B parameter transformer trained with a maximum context length of 73K video tokens, corresponding to a generated video of 16 seconds at 16 frames-per-second. We show multiple technical innovations and simplifications on the architecture, latent spaces, training objectives and recipes, data curation, evaluation protocols, parallelization techniques, and inference optimizations that allow us to reap the benefits of scaling pre-training data, model size, and training compute for training large scale media generation models. We hope this paper helps the research community to accelerate progress and innovation in media generation models.

      <title>The Llama 3 Herd of Models</title>
      <link>https://rohitgirdhar.github.io/publication/2024_llama3/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://rohitgirdhar.github.io/publication/2024_llama3/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems are powered by foundation models. This paper presents a new set of foundation models, called Llama 3. It is a herd of language models that natively support multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is a dense Transformer with 405B parameters and a context window of up to 128K tokens. This paper presents an extensive empirical evaluation of Llama 3. We find that Llama 3 delivers comparable quality to leading language models such as GPT-4 on a plethora of tasks. We publicly release Llama 3, including pre-trained and post-trained versions of the 405B parameter language model and our Llama Guard 3 model for input and output safety. The paper also presents the results of experiments in which we integrate image, video, and speech capabilities into Llama 3 via a compositional approach. We observe this approach performs competitively with the state-of-the-art on image, video, and speech recognition tasks. The resulting models are not yet being broadly released as they are still under development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SoundingActions: Learning How Actions Sound from Narrated Egocentric Videos</title>
      <link>https://rohitgirdhar.github.io/publication/2024_soundingactions/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://rohitgirdhar.github.io/publication/2024_soundingactions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We propose a novel self-supervised embedding to learn how actions sound from narrated in-the-wild egocentric videos. Whereas existing methods rely on curated data with known audio-visual correspondence, our multimodal contrastive-consensus coding (MC3) embedding reinforces the associations between audio, language, and vision when all modality pairs agree, while diminishing those associations when any one pair does not. We show our approach can successfully discover how the long tail of human actions sound from egocentric video, outperforming an array of recent multimodal embedding techniques on two datasets (Ego4D and EPIC-Sounds) and multiple cross-modal tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Generating Illustrated Instructions</title>
      <link>https://rohitgirdhar.github.io/publication/2023_illustratedinstructions/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://rohitgirdhar.github.io/publication/2023_illustratedinstructions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We introduce the new task of generating Illustrated Instructions, i.e., visual instructions customized to a user&amp;rsquo;s needs. We identify desiderata unique to this task, and formalize it through a suite of automatic and human evaluation metrics, designed to measure the validity, consistency, and efficacy of the generations. We combine the power of large language models (LLMs) together with strong text-to-image generation diffusion models to propose a simple approach called StackedDiffusion, which generates such illustrated instructions given text as input. The resulting model strongly outperforms baseline approaches and state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs; and in 30% of cases, users even prefer it to human-generated articles. Most notably, it enables various new and exciting applications far beyond what static articles on the web can provide, such as personalized instructions complete with intermediate steps and pictures in response to a user&amp;rsquo;s individual situation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Motion-Conditioned Image Animation for Video Editing</title>
      <link>https://rohitgirdhar.github.io/publication/2023_moca/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://rohitgirdhar.github.io/publication/2023_moca/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We introduce MoCA, a Motion-Conditioned Image Animation approach for video editing. It leverages a simple decomposition of the video editing problem into image editing followed by motion-conditioned image animation. Furthermore, given the lack of robust evaluation datasets for video editing, we introduce a new benchmark that measures edit capability across a wide variety of tasks, such as object replacement, background changes, style changes, and motion edits. We present a comprehensive human evaluation of the latest video editing methods along with MoCA, on our proposed benchmark. MoCA establishes a new state-of-the-art, demonstrating greater human preference win-rate, and outperforming notable recent approaches including Dreamix (63%), MasaCtrl (75%), and Tune-A-Video (72%), with especially significant improvements for motion edits.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Emu Video: Factorizing Text-to-Video Generation by Explicit Image Conditioning</title>
      <link>https://rohitgirdhar.github.io/publication/2023_emuvideo/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://rohitgirdhar.github.io/publication/2023_emuvideo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We present Emu Video, a text-to-video generation model that factorizes the generation into two steps: first generating an image conditioned on the text, and then generating a video conditioned on the text and the generated image. We identify critical design decisions&amp;ndash;adjusted noise schedules for diffusion, and multi-stage training&amp;ndash;that enable us to directly generate high quality and high resolution videos, without requiring a deep cascade of models as in prior work. In human evaluations, our generated videos are strongly preferred in quality compared to all prior work&amp;ndash;81% vs. Google&amp;rsquo;s Imagen Video, 90% vs. Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s PYOCO, and 96% vs. Meta&amp;rsquo;s Make-A-Video. Our model outperforms commercial solutions such as RunwayML&amp;rsquo;s Gen2 and Pika Labs. Finally, our factorizing approach naturally lends itself to animating images based on a user&amp;rsquo;s text prompt, where our generations are preferred 96% over prior work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ImageBind: One Embedding Space To Bind Them All</title>
      <link>https://rohitgirdhar.github.io/publication/2023_imagebind/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://rohitgirdhar.github.io/publication/2023_imagebind/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We present ImageBind, an approach to learn a joint embedding across six different modalities - images, text, audio, depth, thermal, and IMU data. We show that all combinations of paired data are not necessary to train such a joint embedding, and only image-paired data is sufficient to bind the modalities together. ImageBind can leverage recent large scale vision-language models, and extends their zero-shot capabilities to new modalities just by using their natural pairing with images. It enables novel emergent applications &amp;lsquo;out-of-the-box&amp;rsquo; including cross-modal retrieval, composing modalities with arithmetic, cross-modal detection and generation. The emergent capabilities improve with the strength of the image encoder and we set a new state-of-the-art on emergent zero-shot recognition tasks across modalities, outperforming specialist supervised models. Finally, we show strong few-shot recognition results outperforming prior work, and that ImageBind serves as a new way to evaluate vision models for visual and non-visual tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HierVL: Learning Hierarchical Video-Language Embeddings</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Video-language embeddings are a promising avenue for injecting semantics into visual representations, but existing methods capture only short-term associations between seconds-long video clips and their accompanying text. We propose HierVL, a novel hierarchical video-language embedding that simultaneously accounts for both long-term and short-term associations. As training data, we take videos accompanied by timestamped text descriptions of human actions, together with a high-level text summary of the activity throughout the long video (as are available in Ego4D). We introduce a hierarchical contrastive training objective that encourages text-visual alignment at both the clip level and video level. While the clip-level constraints use the step-by-step descriptions to capture what is happening in that instant, the video-level constraints use the summary text to capture why it is happening, i.e., the broader context for the activity and the intent of the actor. Our hierarchical scheme yields a clip representation that outperforms its single-level counterpart as well as a long-term video representation that achieves SotA results on tasks requiring long-term video modeling. HierVL successfully transfers to multiple challenging downstream tasks (in EPIC-KITCHENS-100, Charades-Ego, HowTo100M) in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>OmniMAE: Single Model Masked Pretraining on Images and Videos</title>
      <link>https://rohitgirdhar.github.io/publication/2022_omnimae/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Transformer-based architectures have become competitive across a variety of visual domains, most notably images and videos. While prior work studies these modalities in isolation, having a common architecture suggests that one can train a single unified model for multiple visual modalities. Prior attempts at unified modeling typically use architectures tailored for vision tasks, or obtain worse performance compared to single modality models. In this work, we show that masked autoencoding can be used to train a simple Vision Transformer on images and videos, without requiring any labeled data. This single model learns visual representations that are comparable to or better than single-modality representations on both image and video benchmarks, while using a much simpler architecture. Furthermore, this model can be learned by dropping 90% of the image and 95% of the video patches, enabling extremely fast training of huge model architectures. In particular, we show that our single ViT-Huge model can be finetuned to achieve 86.6% on ImageNet and 75.5% on the challenging Something Something-v2 video benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Omnivore: A Single Model for Many Visual Modalities</title>
      <link>https://rohitgirdhar.github.io/publication/2022_omnivore/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://rohitgirdhar.github.io/publication/2022_omnivore/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prior work has studied different visual modalities in isolation and developed separate architectures for recognition of images, videos, and 3D data. Instead, in this paper, we propose a single model which excels at classifying images, videos, and single-view 3D data using exactly the same model parameters. Our &amp;lsquo;OMNIVORE&amp;rsquo; model leverages the flexibility of transformer-based architectures and is trained jointly on classification tasks from different modalities. OMNIVORE is simple to train, uses off-the-shelf standard datasets, and performs at-par or better than modality-specific models of the same size. A single OMNIVORE model obtains 86.0% on ImageNet, 84.1% on Kinetics, and 67.1% on SUN RGB-D. After finetuning, our models outperform prior work on a variety of vision tasks and generalize across modalities. OMNIVORE&amp;rsquo;s shared visual representation naturally enables cross-modal recognition without access to correspondences between modalities. We hope our results motivate researchers to model visual modalities together.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ego4D: Around the World in 3,000 Hours of Egocentric Video</title>
      <link>https://rohitgirdhar.github.io/publication/2022_ego4d/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://rohitgirdhar.github.io/publication/2022_ego4d/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We introduce Ego4D, a massive-scale egocentric video dataset and benchmark suite. It offers 3,670 hours of daily-life activity video spanning hundreds of scenarios (household, outdoor, workplace, leisure, etc.) captured by 931 unique camera wearers from 74 worldwide locations and 9 different countries. The approach to collection is designed to uphold rigorous privacy and ethics standards with consenting participants and robust de-identification procedures where relevant. Ego4D dramatically expands the volume of diverse egocentric video footage publicly available to the research community. Portions of the video are accompanied by audio, 3D meshes of the environment, eye gaze, stereo, and/or synchronized videos from multiple egocentric cameras at the same event. Furthermore, we present a host of new benchmark challenges centered around understanding the first-person visual experience in the past (querying an episodic memory), present (analyzing hand-object manipulation, audio-visual conversation, and social interactions), and future (forecasting activities). By publicly sharing this massive annotated dataset and benchmark suite, we aim to push the frontier of first-person perception.&lt;/p&gt;
